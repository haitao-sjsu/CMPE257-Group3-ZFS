Hi, we are looking to fill 1 or 2 private rooms in our 4 bed/3 bath house in the Berryessa area of San Jose. Our lease is expiring in 6 months and we plan to vacate the house at that time. We are located close to 680/280/101, VTA light rail, and BART, and there are many stores and restaurants in the area.
The house has a 3 car garage which will have 1 available spot. The neighborhood is safe so street parking is not an issue. We also have a decent sized back yard/patio with a grill and golf mat/net.
Rent and utilities would be in the range of $1600/mo max (depending on total rooms filled). The three of us who currently live here are 20-30 yr old professionals who work full time (engineering/construction). We have our own friend groups but also hang out from time to time by golfing, watching sports, or going out to the bars.

After searching up his name in public court records he has several other small claims cases against him by other tenants who had their security deposit stolen.
