,,,"I am currently seeking roommates to join me on a new lease right away. There is a room available in the 33S 3rd St Apartments, located in downtown San Jose. The apartment is conveniently situated just a 2-minute walk from SJSU. It is a spacious 2-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom duplex townhouse.
The living area, which has been converted into a large hall, offers ample space measuring 14 by 14 feet, and includes a private half bathroom. The rent for a single occupant is $1000, but if there are two occupants, the rent is $550 each. Additionally, a deposit and utilities will be required. The room is available immediately.
You will be living with working professionals who already occupy other rooms in the apartment. As they are mostly out during the day, you can expect a quiet living environment. While you will be sharing a shower, you will have your own personal bathroom.
Upstairs, there are two bedrooms, ensuring you have optimal privacy. The apartment itself is spacious and well-equipped with amenities such as a washer, dryer, air conditioning, and parking facilities.
Within a short 2-7 minute walk, you will find grocery stores, salons, cafes, restaurants, a library, a canteen, VTA transportation, and a light rail station. Your roommates are peaceful and helpful, and they also have a car, so they would be more than happy to take you to the grocery store or accompany you to the mall, and so on.

Hello everyone! We've recently leased a spacious 2B2B apartment and are on the lookout for a tidy and respectful roommate. This opportunity is ideal for female students, working professionals, or a couple who appreciate downtown living.

The available bedroom is spacious, filled with natural light, and comes with an attached closet and private bathroom. It can comfortably accommodate an individual or double occupancy - we are preferably looking for female roommates in case of sharing.

The monthly rent will range between $1600-$1700, not including utilities, and it's a year-long lease.

Our apartment boasts a prime location - it's a stone's throw away from San Jose State University, the MLK Library, and the SRAC gym. It's also in close proximity to public transport hubs (VTA, BART, Diridon Train Station), shopping centers like Whole Foods and Bargain Market, and the lively San Pedro Square.

The apartment is part of a gated community featuring an on-site gym. Our shared living room and kitchen are well-equipped and sunny.

We're in search of a roommate who doesn't smoke/vape, respects personal space, and maintains cleanliness in common areas. Occasional weekend parties are fine, and we have no restrictions on veg/non-veg food.

If this sounds like your ideal space, don't hesitate to drop us a message for more details or to arrange a visit. Let's create a harmonious living space together!

URGENT POST! I'm reletting a double occupancy room (Bedroom A) in a D1 floorplan (floors 3-7), where the lease starts August 19, 2023, and ends July 31st, 2024. Rent is $1223, with utilities included! This is an urgent post since I was planning on moving into The Grad next semester but was accepted into another school and need to find someone to take over soon!! This spot was one of the first ones to be taken up back in February due to it being more accessible to the lower floors and the cheapest option at The Grad. 

‚Ä¢ You would be sharing the space with someone else, but it's a very large room. There are separate closets and an attached shared bathroom.

‚Ä¢ Super close to campus, probably around a 5-minute walk at most

‚Ä¢ Fully furnished (FULL XL bed, desk, etc.) & in-unit washer and dryer

‚Ä¢ Amenities: Pool and deck, fitness center, Outdoor areas, Study lounges, etc.

As common courtesy of signing with such limited time, I would like to offer some amount of money as a gift. If you need help paying the pet deposit or need something for your future apartment space, I would love to pay it off as a thank you. I‚Äôm also willing to help cover some of the rent for the first couple months.

The room is $1025/month with utilities around $50-100/month, and is located right next to the Diridon Station (light rail/trains/busses), the SAP Center, Whole Foods, Cahill Park, and the Alameda shopping district with lots of restaurants and amenities. SJSU campus and downtown is super accessible by light rail or car (10 mins). It is a gorgeous million dollar home and you can't beat the price in San Jose for what you get.
Check out the pics here: (the first two room photos is the one available)(& there is no longer carpeting - all the rooms have new hardwood floors) https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/235-Kentdale-Pl-San-Jose-CA-95126/69299696_zpid/
The current roommates are: 3 spiritual gals and 1 cat named Oreo. We are all in our mid 20's (24, 25, 26) and are either working/or working and in school. We are into astrology and tarot reading, cooking, watching TV, environmentalism, and reading. Two of us have been living here for a year and a half, and the other moved in this year. We enjoy each others company but have our own lives and busy schedules.
Our ideal 4th roommate would be: pet-free (or if you have a pet it would have to get along with our cat), car-free, clean/down to help out with chores, communicative, considerate, 420 friendly, in their mid-later 20s, and someone who does not usually shower before 7-8am (my room shares a wall with the shower and it wakes me up), and is financially stable.
The house was built in 2006 so super modern. If you love to cook, the kitchen is HUGE! There is a 2 car garage so you will have room to store things in it if you would like. There is a really nice park only a few hundred feet away from the front door.

Rent is $1223, with utilities included! This is an urgent post since I was planning on moving into The Grad next semester but was accepted into another school and need to find someone to take over by JUNE 1ST!!

‚Ä¢ You would be sharing the space with someone else, but it's a very large room. There are separate closets and an attached shared bathroom.

‚Ä¢ Super close to campus, probably around a 5-minute walk at most

‚Ä¢ Fully furnished (FULL XL bed, desk, etc.) & in-unit washer and dryer

‚Ä¢ Amenities: Pool and deck, fitness center, Outdoor areas, Study lounges, etc.

As common courtesy of signing with such limited time, I would like to offer some amount of money as a gift. If you need help paying the pet deposit or need something for your future apartment space, I would love to pay it off as a thank you. 

Please message me ASAP if you are interested or know someone else who would be interested! My Instagram is @agape.t and my phone number is 669-226-8194

My name is Jayce Lee, and I will open this post up by stating that I am a transgender man (born female). I also own two rats that will not be let out of their cage - I promise they are friendly, and I clean the cage often. If neither of these facts make you uncomfortable, then please continue reading.

I am looking to share an apartment at least 10 miles from SJSU, however, if you are further than that, please do not hesitate to reach out. My budget is $1,000/mo, but I am willing to go up to $1,300/mo on special occasion. I am looking to move in at the start of the new Fall semester (mid August), and looking to stay until either the end of that same Fall semester. I can reliably make payments on time, and send money electronically through Zelle or Venmo.

Now, about myself: I'm a kind, friendly, and understanding person who can adapt well to changes or preferences of other roommates. I keep my own bedspace and shared spaces clean. I will not be bringing many things, so I will be able to occupy a small space of the house. I have a good sleep schedule, and would appreciate an apartment that does not hold loud parties or meetings after 10PM. I am part of AROTC, so I have a busy schedule and may not be home very often.

Overall, I'm very easy to get along with, and looking for roommates that will not dislike me for my identity. I do not mind rooming with all females, as long as I am respected.
