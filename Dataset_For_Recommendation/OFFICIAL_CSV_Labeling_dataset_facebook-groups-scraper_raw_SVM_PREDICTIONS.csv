Hi, we are looking to fill 1 or 2 private rooms in our 4 bed/3 bath house in the Berryessa area of San Jose. Our lease is expiring in 6 months and we plan to vacate the house at that time. We are located close to 680/280/101, VTA light rail, and BART, and there are many stores and restaurants in the area.
The house has a 3 car garage which will have 1 available spot. The neighborhood is safe so street parking is not an issue. We also have a decent sized back yard/patio with a grill and golf mat/net.
Rent and utilities would be in the range of $1600/mo max (depending on total rooms filled). The three of us who currently live here are 20-30 yr old professionals who work full time (engineering/construction). We have our own friend groups but also hang out from time to time by golfing, watching sports, or going out to the bars.

Hi everyone, Leo and I are looking for 2 more people to join in on a lease in Santa Clara. One room is currently available and the other room will start around September 30th, 2023. Rent is $1,084 per month for the regular room. Utilities and wifi are separated. 

Some background about us:

I’m Daniel 23 yrs old. I graduated from King’s College London 2 years ago and currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer and doing a master's degree in Engineering Management at Santa Clara University. Likes to boulder, practice martial arts, play guitar/ukulele, play volleyball with friends, make sushi and other fire japanese food, and hike around.

Leo:
Hey there, I'm a 21-year-old software engineer based in Sunnyvale, CA. When I'm not immersed in coding and creating software magic, you can find me exploring the great outdoors through hiking, seeking out new gaming adventures, and hitting the gym to stay fit. I'm a true foodie at heart, whether it's whipping up culinary delights in the kitchen or savoring delicious dishes from around the world. As a recent grad, I'm excited about my journey in the tech world and can't wait to continue balancing work with my love for travel, experiencing new places, cultures, and cuisines.

Hello everyone! We've recently leased a spacious 2B2B apartment and are on the lookout for a tidy and respectful roommate. This opportunity is ideal for female students, working professionals, or a couple who appreciate downtown living.

The available bedroom is spacious, filled with natural light, and comes with an attached closet and private bathroom. It can comfortably accommodate an individual or double occupancy - we are preferably looking for female roommates in case of sharing.

The monthly rent will range between $1600-$1700, not including utilities, and it's a year-long lease.

Our apartment boasts a prime location - it's a stone's throw away from San Jose State University, the MLK Library, and the SRAC gym. It's also in close proximity to public transport hubs (VTA, BART, Diridon Train Station), shopping centers like Whole Foods and Bargain Market, and the lively San Pedro Square.

The apartment is part of a gated community featuring an on-site gym. Our shared living room and kitchen are well-equipped and sunny.

We're in search of a roommate who doesn't smoke/vape, respects personal space, and maintains cleanliness in common areas. Occasional weekend parties are fine, and we have no restrictions on veg/non-veg food.

If this sounds like your ideal space, don't hesitate to drop us a message for more details or to arrange a visit. Let's create a harmonious living space together!

URGENT POST! I'm reletting a double occupancy room (Bedroom A) in a D1 floorplan (floors 3-7), where the lease starts August 19, 2023, and ends July 31st, 2024. Rent is $1223, with utilities included! This is an urgent post since I was planning on moving into The Grad next semester but was accepted into another school and need to find someone to take over soon!! This spot was one of the first ones to be taken up back in February due to it being more accessible to the lower floors and the cheapest option at The Grad. 

• You would be sharing the space with someone else, but it's a very large room. There are separate closets and an attached shared bathroom.

• Super close to campus, probably around a 5-minute walk at most

• Fully furnished (FULL XL bed, desk, etc.) & in-unit washer and dryer

• Amenities: Pool and deck, fitness center, Outdoor areas, Study lounges, etc.

As common courtesy of signing with such limited time, I would like to offer some amount of money as a gift. If you need help paying the pet deposit or need something for your future apartment space, I would love to pay it off as a thank you. I’m also willing to help cover some of the rent for the first couple months. 

Please message me ASAP if you are interested or know someone else who would be interested!

SJSU campus and downtown is super accessible by light rail or car (10 mins). It is a gorgeous million dollar home and you can't beat the price in San Jose for what you get.

The current roommates are: 3 spiritual gals and 1 cat named Oreo. We are all in our mid 20's (24, 25, 26) and are either working/or working and in school. We are into astrology and tarot reading, cooking, watching TV, environmentalism, and reading. Two of us have been living here for a year and a half, and the other moved in this year. We enjoy each others company but have our own lives and busy schedules.
Our ideal 4th roommate would be: pet-free (or if you have a pet it would have to get along with our cat), car-free, clean/down to help out with chores, communicative, considerate, 420 friendly, in their mid-later 20s, and someone who does not usually shower before 7-8am (my room shares a wall with the shower and it wakes me up), and is financially stable.
The house was built in 2006 so super modern. If you love to cook, the kitchen is HUGE! There is a 2 car garage so you will have room to store things in it if you would like. There is a really nice park only a few hundred feet away from the front door.

URGENT POST! I'm reletting a double occupancy room (Bedroom A) in a D1 floorplan (floors 3-7), where the lease starts August 19, 2023, and ends July 31st, 2024. Rent is $1223, with utilities included! This is an urgent post since I was planning on moving into The Grad next semester but was accepted into another school and need to find someone to take over by JUNE 1ST!!

• You would be sharing the space with someone else, but it's a very large room. There are separate closets and an attached shared bathroom.

• Super close to campus, probably around a 5-minute walk at most

• Fully furnished (FULL XL bed, desk, etc.) & in-unit washer and dryer

• Amenities: Pool and deck, fitness center, Outdoor areas, Study lounges, etc.

As common courtesy of signing with such limited time, I would like to offer some amount of money as a gift. If you need help paying the pet deposit or need something for your future apartment space, I would love to pay it off as a thank you. 

Please message me ASAP if you are interested or know someone else who would be interested! My Instagram is @agape.t and my phone number is 669-226-8194

My name is Jayce Lee, and I will open this post up by stating that I am a transgender man (born female). I also own two rats that will not be let out of their cage - I promise they are friendly, and I clean the cage often. If neither of these facts make you uncomfortable, then please continue reading.

I am looking to share an apartment at least 10 miles from SJSU, however, if you are further than that, please do not hesitate to reach out. My budget is $1,000/mo, but I am willing to go up to $1,300/mo on special occasion. I am looking to move in at the start of the new Fall semester (mid August), and looking to stay until either the end of that same Fall semester. I can reliably make payments on time, and send money electronically through Zelle or Venmo.

Now, about myself: I'm a kind, friendly, and understanding person who can adapt well to changes or preferences of other roommates. I keep my own bedspace and shared spaces clean. I will not be bringing many things, so I will be able to occupy a small space of the house. I have a good sleep schedule, and would appreciate an apartment that does not hold loud parties or meetings after 10PM. I am part of AROTC, so I have a busy schedule and may not be home very often.

Overall, I'm very easy to get along with, and looking for roommates that will not dislike me for my identity. I do not mind rooming with all females, as long as I am respected.

I'm an Environmental Studies major from the University of Michigan Class of 2021 and I'll be working at the San Jose Conservation Corps as part of the California Climate Action Corps fellowship this summer.
I'm currently on the lookout for some temporary housing in South San Jose, Willow Glen for the duration of my fellowship from June to August.

I'm a friendly and outgoing person and would love to make some new friends during my time in San Jose. I enjoy exploring new places and cultures, and I love to get out of my comfort zone. If you share any of these interests or qualities, let's connect!
