I see that his post is still up on craigslist so just wanted to warn others about this posting. The low rent price is likely used to lure people in.

,"üè° Roommate Wanted Alert in Downtown San Jose! üè°

Hello everyone! We've recently leased a spacious 2B2B apartment and are on the lookout for a tidy and respectful roommate. This opportunity is ideal for female students, working professionals, or a couple who appreciate downtown living.

The available bedroom is spacious, filled with natural light, and comes with an attached closet and private bathroom. It can comfortably accommodate an individual or double occupancy - we are preferably looking for female roommates in case of sharing.

The monthly rent will range between $1600-$1700, not including utilities, and it's a year-long lease.

Our apartment boasts a prime location - it's a stone's throw away from San Jose State University, the MLK Library, and the SRAC gym. It's also in close proximity to public transport hubs (VTA, BART, Diridon Train Station), shopping centers like Whole Foods and Bargain Market, and the lively San Pedro Square.

The apartment is part of a gated community featuring an on-site gym. Our shared living room and kitchen are well-equipped and sunny.

We're in search of a roommate who doesn't smoke/vape, respects personal space, and maintains cleanliness in common areas. Occasional weekend parties are fine, and we have no restrictions on veg/non-veg food.

If this sounds like your ideal space, don't hesitate to drop us a message for more details or to arrange a visit. Let's create a harmonious living space together!

,"Anyone looking to sublease for the summer or looking to move into The Grad before August 19th:  

I‚Äôm looking to possibly sublet my room at The Grad until the end of July (female preferred). It‚Äôs a single with its own (detached) bathroom. It‚Äôs a 4-bedroom floor plan but with only me and my other roommate in the apartment (I would be switching to another room in the apartment if I were to sublet and leave in early July). The rent is $1575, with all utilities and wifi included. The apartment is very clean, on the 11th floor, and has in-unit laundry. The building has a pool deck (with a hot tub), a 24-hour gym, a yoga studio, a dog area, a multipurpose room, and study rooms. Since I‚Äôm switching to another room for the next leasing term, my current room is available for renewal. Meaning if you subleased you could do a straight renewal into August and not have to move in on August 19th. Normally at The Grad when you start a new lease you have to wait until a set date to move in (August 19th), but subleasing before the new lease bypasses that process. That lease rate (starting in August) would be $1675. Message me if you‚Äôre interested!"

We are into astrology and tarot reading, cooking, watching TV, environmentalism, and reading. Two of us have been living here for a year and a half, and the other moved in this year. We enjoy each others company but have our own lives and busy schedules.
Our ideal 4th roommate would be: pet-free (or if you have a pet it would have to get along with our cat), car-free, clean/down to help out with chores, communicative, considerate, 420 friendly, in their mid-later 20s, and someone who does not usually shower before 7-8am (my room shares a wall with the shower and it wakes me up), and is financially stable.
The house was built in 2006 so super modern. If you love to cook, the kitchen is HUGE! There is a 2 car garage so you will have room to store things in it if you would like. There is a really nice park only a few hundred feet away from the front door.

,"LOOKING, Either (Please read first paragraph)

My name is Jayce Lee, and I will open this post up by stating that I am a transgender man (born female). I also own two rats that will not be let out of their cage - I promise they are friendly, and I clean the cage often. If neither of these facts make you uncomfortable, then please continue reading.

I am looking to share an apartment at least 10 miles from SJSU, however, if you are further than that, please do not hesitate to reach out. My budget is $1,000/mo, but I am willing to go up to $1,300/mo on special occasion. I am looking to move in at the start of the new Fall semester (mid August), and looking to stay until either the end of that same Fall semester. I can reliably make payments on time, and send money electronically through Zelle or Venmo.

Now, about myself: I'm a kind, friendly, and understanding person who can adapt well to changes or preferences of other roommates. I keep my own bedspace and shared spaces clean. I will not be bringing many things, so I will be able to occupy a small space of the house. I have a good sleep schedule, and would appreciate an apartment that does not hold loud parties or meetings after 10PM. I am part of AROTC, so I have a busy schedule and may not be home very often.

Overall, I'm very easy to get along with, and looking for roommates that will not dislike me for my identity. I do not mind rooming with all females, as long as I am respected.

Thank you for reading!"
